# AkulAI

Note: First off, don't forget to download the ASR model from [here](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models), unzip it, rename it to `vosk_model` and place it in the `akulai` directory. It won't work without that. Also make sure you have Node.js installed. And finally, for the perl plugins, install any kind of Perl installation, although I recommend Strawbery Perl. Also make sure that you have cpamn installed and have perl in your PATH for Windows.

### Installation
Again, you may either follow the steps above, or you may use the provided python script. We have also provided a PowerShell, Perl, and Bash script. If you face any errors, however, please use the python script before reporting it.

Keep in mind that:
 - The Perl script assumes you already have a working installation of Perl, cpamn, and Python installed.
 - Every other script also assumes you have a working installation of Python installed.

<hr>
Version 2 is OUT! We plan to release a stable version sometime near the end of February, so stay tuned! I will update from time to time, but as a solo developer (during the time of writing), please don't expect a lot.

Please share this and contribute to it, I would love to get some help. If you don't know what to do to help, take a look at todo.md. Or the issues. Your choice.

## How do I create a skill...??

Check the `create_plugins.md` file. We now support JS and Perl plugins too! (To share your plugins, see the [akulai plugins](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai-plugins) repository.

## What happened to the other version?

Go to the [master-v1 branch](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai/tree/master-v1) for the code. If you did see this code when it was being developed, thank you for supporting us for so long!

## Pointless Information (Kinda)

We use semantic versioning. That's it so far.
