# AkulAI Core

Note: First off, don't forget to download the ASR model from [here](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models), unzip it, rename it to `vosk_model` and place it in the `akulai` directory. It won't work without that. Also, for TTS to work, make sure you have espeakng installed in your system. See their [Pypi project](https://pypi.org/project/espeakng/) to see how you can get it installed. Also make sure you have Node.js installed before installing PyNodeJS. See their [Github docs](https://github.com/sancho1952007/PyNodeJS) for more details. And finally, for the perl plugins, install ActivePerl.

### Installation
Again, you may either follow the steps above, or you may use the provided python script. We have also provided a PowerShell and Bash script. If you face any errors, however, please use the python script before reporting it.

<hr>
Version 2 is OUT! We plan to release a stable version sometime near the end of February, so stay tuned! I will update from time to time, but as a solo developer (during the time of writing), please don't expect a lot.

Please share this and contribute to it, I would love to get some help. If you don't know what to do to help, take a look at todo.md. Or the issues. Your choice.

## How do I create a skill...??

Check the `create_plugins.md` file. We now support JS and Perl plugins too! (To share your plugins, see the [akulai plugins](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai-plugins) repository.

## What happened to the other version?

Go to the [master-v1 branch](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai/tree/master-v1) for the code. If you did see this code when it was being developed, thank you for supporting us for so long!

## Pointless Information (Kinda)

We use semantic versioning. That's it so far.
