# AkulAI Core

Note: For TTS to work, make sure you have espeakng installed in your system. See their [Pypi project](https://pypi.org/project/espeakng/) to see how you can get it installed. Also make sure you have Node.js installed before installing PyNodeJS. See their [Github docs](https://github.com/sancho1952007/PyNodeJS) for more details.

Version 2 is OUT!  I will update from time to time, but as a solo developer (during the time of writing), please don't expect a lot.

Please share this and contribute to it, I would love to get some help. If you don't know what to do to help, take a look at todo.md. Or the issues. Your choice.

## How do I create a skill...??

Check the `plugins` directory! We now support JS plugins too!

## What happened to the other one?

Go to the (master-v1 branch)[https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai/tree/master-v1] for the code. If you did see this code when it was being developed, thank you for supporting us for so long!

## Pointless Information (Kinda)

We use semantic versioning. That's it so far.
