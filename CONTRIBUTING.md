It's really simple:

1. Try not to rely on online services as much as possible.
2. Test your code. Feel free to add your tests to the test folder, but make sure you end the file with `_test` and then whatever file type you are using for testing.
3. Make the code as simple as possible (add inline documentation if needed).

Yeah, that's basically it. Thanks for contributing!
